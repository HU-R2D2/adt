//! @brief      Attitude represents some form of rotation around the
//!             x, y and z axes. These are called the pitch, yaw and roll.
//!             the pitch yaw and roll are the only attributes of Attitude
//!             and are Angle values.
//!             Therefore to create an Attitude, 3 Angles must be given.
//!
//!             For example:
//!             Attitude a(1 * Angle::rad, 2 * Angle::rad, 3 * Angle::rad)
//!             This gives an Attitude with a 1rad pitch, a 2rad yaw and
//!             a 3rad roll.
