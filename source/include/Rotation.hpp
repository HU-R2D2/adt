//! @brief      Rotation is a delta variant of an Attitude. Therefore it 
//!             represents some form of rotation around the x, y and z axes.
//!             These are called the pitch, yaw and roll.
//!             the pitch yaw and roll are the only attributes of Rotation
//!             and are Angle values.
//!             Therefore to create a Rotation, 3 Angles must be given.
//!
//!             For example:
//!             Totation a(1 * Angle::rad, 2 * Angle::rad, 3 * Angle::rad)
//!             This gives a Rotation with a 1rad pitch, a 2rad yaw and
//!             a 3rad roll.
