//! @brief      Length is a Length is a measurement of a size that is being
//!             represented by a single value. 
//!             Length stands on its own, this means it has no such thing as
//!             a zero point or a direction.
//!             The only attribute Length has, is the Length itself
//!             To create a length, not only a double must be given,
//!             but also the unit of it (METER or CENTIMETER).
//!
//!             For example:
//!             Length l(5 * Length::METER)
//!             This gives a Length of 5m.
//!             To get a double again, simply divide by the unit.
